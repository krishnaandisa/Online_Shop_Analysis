# Online_Shop_Analysis
A data analysis project using an online shop sales data set from Kaggle user Martha Dimgba. The dataset was imported into PostgreSQL, with the important variables aggregated into a single table called sales_data. This table contains columns such as order_id, order_date, customer_id, name, product_name, category, price_at_purchase, quantity, and total_price. The data was kept mostly as-is to focus on the analysis side of the project.

This project contains five SQL queries that explore key sales and customer metrics. These include total revenue generated, top-performing products, sales over time, purchasing behavior of repeat customers, and category-level performance. The goal was to answer the kinds of questions that might come up in a real business setting using SQL, with an emphasis on clear and readable queries.

All SQL queries used in the analysis are attached in the SQL file in this repository.
